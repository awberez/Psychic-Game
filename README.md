# Psychic Game
Try to guess a random letter! Players have 9 incorrect guesses before a letter is missed, although only guessed letters count (numbers or other unrelated keystrokes are ignored).

Since most mobile devices don't have keyboards, an optional on-screen keyboard is provided so you can play the Psychic Game anywhere!
